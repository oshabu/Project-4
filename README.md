# Human Vs Machine
can you tell if you are over or underweight?

## About this project:
We often think that obesity cause by overeating, however that's not only the case. Nowadays, obesity has become a significant threat for all people from every age, worldwide. Unhealthy lifestyle, eating excessive junk food, late-night sleep, spend a long time sitting down are several factors that contribute to obesity.. "so, if I'm overweight do I mean i am also Obese? what is the difference between overweight and obese?"
Overweight is when the BMI greater than or equal to 25; and how we measure if we are obese is when the BMI (Body Mass Index) is greater than or equal to 30. If you are overweight, potentially you will become obese if precautions being ignored.

## Approach
1. Identify data sources and dependencies
2. Collect and clean trajectory data
3. Applying Machine Learning algorithms (decision tree, Lasso, Random Forest Classifier, XGBClassifier)
4. Comparative Analysis
5. Create Flask App and connect routes to local host
6. Create charts and map using Tableau
7. Customise html for final application
8. Visualise dashboard locally
